<h1><b>Start editing to observe custom observables</b></h1>

Observables are lazy Push collections of multiple values.
Pull and Push are two different protocols that describe how a data Producer can communicate with a data Consumer.

What is Pull? In Pull systems, the Consumer determines when it receives data from the data Producer. The Producer itself
is unaware of when the data will be delivered to the Consumer.

Every JavaScript Function is a Pull system. The function is a Producer of data, and the code that calls the function is
consuming it by "pulling" out a single return value from its call.

ES2015 introduced generator functions and iterators (function*), another type of Pull system. Code that calls
iterator.next() is the Consumer, "pulling" out multiple values from the iterator (the Producer).
